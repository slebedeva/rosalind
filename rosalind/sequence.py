Utility functions to process nucleic acid sequences.

The functions are tailored to solving Rosalind problems but can be used independently.

Included functions:
    is_valid:           Checks if a given string is a valid nucleic acid sequence.
    reverse_complement: Returns reverse complement of a DNA or RNA sequence.
    hamming_distance:   Calculates Hamming distance (substitution only) between two sequences of equal length.
    find_motif:         Returns 1-based starts of all locations of a motif within given sequence (exact match).
